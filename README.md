# To-Do Web App

## Overview
This is a simple and intuitive To-Do web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by adding, marking as complete, and deleting tasks. The application also stores tasks locally in the browser, ensuring that data persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Mark as Complete:** Tasks can be marked as complete, which visually distinguishes them from incomplete tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can easily remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain available even after the page is refreshed.
